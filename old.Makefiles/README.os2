             README for OS/2 (XFree86) port of Lincity


Ronald Van Iwaarden (rvaniwaa@cs.hope.edu) did the port
of Lincity to XFree86 for OS/2 using EMX gcc. His changes
in the source have been included before 1.0.

Alexander Mai (st002279@hrzpub.tu-darmstadt.de) supplied the new
Makefile.os2 and a few new patches.

Note: To compile under OS/2 use:
      x11make -f makefile.os2
The command above will show you the available targets.
