Current status
--------------

Version 1.11 is partly translatable.  Just substitute
the files in "messages" and "help" with your translations.
You'll also have to substitute the fonts from version 1.12 so 
that accented characters are visible.

Version 1.12 has better translation support.  Strings which are 
embedded in the code are marked using gettext.  It also contains
the necessary ISO-8859-1 font.  It supports multiple languages 
on the same installation by changing environment variables.
Finally, there is a Catalan translation for v 1.12 which you can use 
as an example.


Getting the catalan version to work on v 1.12
---------------------------------------------

Do a configure, make and make install.  Then set LANGUAGE environment
variable to "ca", and run.  Only the messages will be in Catalan 
(since that is the only part of the translation that is done), but at 
least you can see the translated "Not enough tech" message if you try to 
build a high tech item like a rocket ship.
