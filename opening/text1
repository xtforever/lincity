                                              Press any key to continue.  A
help system is available by clicking the mouse on the help 
button in the lower right corner of the main screen... or click
the RIGHT mouse button on the things you want help with. You do not need a
mouse though, the cursor keys make mouse movements, the space or return are
like clicking the left mouse button, the backspace key, like the right. In
dialogue boxes, return or space means OK, return, space or y means yes and
backspace or n means no.
